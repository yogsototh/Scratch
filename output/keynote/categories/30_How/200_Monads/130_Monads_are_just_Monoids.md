-----------------------

> A Monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the problem?

The real sentence was:

> All told, a monad in X is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors of X,
> with product Ã— replaced by composition of endofunctors
> and unit set by the identity endofunctor.
