Lost Higway is a really good movie. You keep watching it event it seem totally obscure. This is one of the strength of David Lynch.


The first time I watched Lost Highway, I was a bit lost.
Here some of explanations of Lost Highway I found on the Internet:

  - Fred make a pact with the devil incarnated by the *Mysterious Man*,
  - *Mysterious Man* is a video camera,
  - Just the first part of the story is real. The rest is in the Fred's imagination,

and I don't speak about many point of view found in forums.

I finished to find two good site talking about this movie. But none of them still totally convinced me:

  - the first is [mediacircus](http://www.mediacircus.net/lh.html),
  - the second which state almost the same interpretation about the movie and explain with even more details is on [jasonweb](http://www.jasonsweb.com/LostHighway/main.htm)

Nonetheless, this movie must be watched knowing you'll cannot resolve the solution. At his best you'll can suggest an interpretation close to the one of David Lynch.

I believe I had found a coherent interpretation which allow to follow the movie **without being totally lost**. I believed it can give the keys necessary to make its own idea of the movie.

## The Rorschach test

Like the protagonist, everybody see what he want to see in this movie. It is an invitation to think. Watch this movie is a little like watch a Rorschach's test. What do we see in it? Everybody put its own personnality in the interpretation of the movie.

  - If you are mystic, you'll see in the mysterious man a devil,
  - If you are more psychanalytics, you'll see an inconscient part of the protagonist...

Generally, we stay in this movie and we fail explaining everything. There is almost always a point that don't fit within the interpretation of the movie. This is why trying to find a unique good interpretation of this movie is a mistake.


## Interpr√©tation &ne; Explanation

I give an **interpretation** and not an **explanation**. Just to tell my vision of the movie should be very different from yours.
There is certainly many coherent explanations.

I write this post because I believe I had found an interpretation which seems coherent for most of the movie.
