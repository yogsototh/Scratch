## The naive design ##

Suppose you want to make a simple todo list application.
In your mind you draw a simple scheme:

<pre>
    [ ] task 1 X
    [ ] task 2 X
    [ ] task 3 X
</pre>

If you click on the box, then it should show the task is done.
If you click on the cross, then it should delete the task from
the list.

You then think:
> "Whoa! That's easy!"

You want to be able to use it as fast as possible
and you also want to complexify this model later.

For example, adding dates, contexts and projects...
