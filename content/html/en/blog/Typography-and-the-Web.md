begindiv(intro)

%tldr Web typography sucks and we'll have to wait forever before it will be fixed.


enddiv

I stumbled upon [open typography](http://opentypography.org/). Their main message is:

> «There is no reason to wait for browser development to catch up.
> We can all create better web typography ourselves, today.»


As somebody who tried to make my website using some nice typography features and in particular _ligatures_, I believe this is wrong.

I already made an automatic system which will detect and replace text by their ligatures in my blog. But this I never published this on the web and this is why.

First, what is a ligatures?

blogimage("ligatures.png", "A ligature example")

What is the problem between the Web and ligatures?
The first one is: you cannot search them. For example, try to search the word "first":

- first ← No ligature, no problem[^1]
- <span class="red">ﬁ</span>r<span class="red">ﬆ </span> ← ligature nice but unsearchable

[^1]: In fact, you might see a ligature and the search works because I now use some CSS ninja skills: `text-rendering: optimizelegibility`. But it also works because I use the right font; Computer Modern. Steal my CSS at will.

The second one is the rendering, for example, try to use a ligature character with small caps:

- <sc>first</sc>
- <sc><span class="red">ﬁ</span>r<span class="red">ﬆ</span></sc>

Here is a screenshot of what I see:

blogimage("first_sc_screenshot.png", "Screenshot of first in small caps with and without ligatures.")

The browser isn't able to understand that the ligature character "<span class="red">ﬁ</span>" should render as <sc>fi</sc> when rendered in small caps. And one part of the problem is you should choose to display a character in small caps using %css.

This way, how could you use a ligature Unicode character on a site on which you could change the %css?

Let's compare to %latex.

blogimage("first_latex_screenshot.png", "LaTeX screenshot")

If you take attention to detail, you'll see the first "first" contains a ligature. Of course the second render nicely. The code I used were:

<code class="latex">
\item first
\item {\sc first}
</code>

%latex was intelligent enough to create himself the ligatures when needed.

The "<span class="red">ﬆ</span>" ligature is rare and not rendered in %latex by default. But if you want you could also render rare ligature using %xelatex:

blogimage("xelatex_ligatures.jpg","XeLaTeX ligatures")

I took this image from the excellent article of [Dario Taraborelli](http://nitens.org/taraborelli/latex#rare).


Clearly fix the rendering of ligature in a browser is a difficult task.
Simply imagine the number of strange little exceptions:

- The text is rendered in small caps, I cannot use ligature.
- The current word contains a ligature unicode character, I should search for ligature in this one.
- The current font does not defined the ligature unicode character, we shouldn't use it, etc
- A javascript command changed the CSS, I should verify if I had to revert the insertion of ligatures characters
- etc...


Nonetheless if someone has a solution, I would be happy to hear about it.
