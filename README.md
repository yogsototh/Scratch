# yannesposito.com

This is the source code for the [yannesposito.com](yannesposito.com) website.

It is mainly a multi-language blog based on [nanoc](nanoc.stoneship.org).

_Notice, this is not a clean system. 
Mainly because I have used it for some years now.
I just want it to work, not to be a nice piece of code.
But in the end I know I will make it clean._

What you'll need to use it:

- [nanoc](nanoc.stoneship.org) → `gem install nanoc`
- [zsh](zsh.org) → Installed by default on most good system
- A bunch of gems: `gem install ultraviolet krambook sass rainpress`

Optionally

- [graphviz](graphviz.org)

Here is a short explanation of the role of each file:


    config.rb            → nanoc central configuration file
    config.ru            → Rack server configuration
    config.yaml          → A YAML configuration file (mostly strings)
    content/             → The directory where nanoc will search for most of the content
    img_latest_blog_dir@ → A link to the latest blog image directory
    latest.md@           → A link to the latest blog file
    layouts/             → HTML Layouts for your webpages
    lib/                 → Some ruby files loaded by nanoc before generating
    multi/               → Where you should write content
    output/              → Where the content is loaded
    Rakefile             → Ruby actions
    README.md            → This file
    resources/           → Some files I used and wanted to keep
    Rules                → Generation rules
    tasks/               → Where I put most of my scripts

    gitmtime.rb  → Show time using git last change log
